	RF433 transceiver firmware.

	This program was made to interface an basic cheapo transceiver 433Mhz
	module with a (linux) host, to let it handle 'grown up' already
	decoded messages for example to use with MQTT, home automation,
	Alexa/Echo and so forth.

	This was made to filter in 433MHZ messages from various remotes and
	sensors, so some appropriate processing on the fly, and pass that
	onward to a host computer for 'real' processing.

	The idea is to have a free running pulse trail detection, and being
	able to notice when it's no longer noise. Firmware can also detect
	Amplitutde-Key Shifting (ASK) or if it's manchester encoding and
	decode both on the fly.

	In the other of operation, firmware can receive the same message
	format with pulses length, and transmit them using a 433MHZ
	transmitter.
